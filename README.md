# CourseGPT

[CourseGPT](https://course-gpt.herokuapp.com/) is more than an AI app - it’s a vision for a more responsive,
personalized education system. By allowing professors to train AI models on-demand, students gain immediate access to
course-specific materials and logistical details. Professors and TA’s can sit back and relax with a personal AI
assistant managing repetitive Q&A, while students can enjoy instant answers to questions for all of their courses in one
place.

## Project Goals

### Minimal Requirements (3/3 ✅)

1. **Simple user login** ✅
   - As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log in
     so that I can access CourseGPT.
2. **Being able to ask questions (1 course supported)** ✅
   - As a student user, I want to be able to ask questions and
     receive answers for at least one supported course so that I can understand
     the course content better.
   - ⚠️NOTE ⚠️ Trained on ALL CPSC 455 website data, not slides or MERN documentation. We felt that, although possible,
     it would not be a valuable use of our time to train CourseGPT on all MERN related documentation, as ChatGPT can
     easily
     provide this.
     - CourseGPT is relatively more useful for course logistics, as well as course-specific content, rather than
       generally available information. For example, courses that have adapted slides, textbooks, or other highly
       tailored course material.
     - CPSC 455 is unique, as there are no bounds on our application of MERN or other technologies - all of which we
       can find help for online or from ChatGPT. This is why we only trained it on website data.
3. **Chat history (view)** ✅
   - As a student user, I want to be able to view my past chat so
     that I can review the information that I've learned.

### Standard Requirements (5/5 ✅)

1. **Deleting chat history** ✅
   - As a student user, I want to be able to clear my chat history
     so that I can keep my chat interface focused on my current
     learning goals.
2. **Feedback on individual messages** ✅
   - As a user, I want to be able to provide feedback on each
     response from CourseGPT so that I can help the developers improve
     CourseGPT
     and further my learning.
3. **Favourite courses** ✅
   - As a student user, I want to be able to favorite courses and
     have them easily selectable when creating a new chat so that I can quickly
     access the courses I'm currently studying. Although I recognize that only
     one course will be significantly trained and useful.
4. **Suggested prompts** ✅
   - As a student user, I want to have suggested prompts based on
     my selected course so that I can get ideas for what questions to ask or
     topics to explore.
5. **ProfileSettings changes** ✅
   - As a user, I want to be able to edit my email and password in my profile
     settings so that I can keep my account information up to date.

### Stretch Requirements (3.5/6 ✅)

1. **Professor improved CourseGPT model** ✅

   - As a professor user, I want to be able to upload text
     that provides more information for training my course
     so that CourseGPT can provide more helpful answers to students.

2. **Multiple Course Support** ⚠️

   - As a student user, I want to be able to select multiple different courses
     and receive helpful assistance in all of them so that I can learn more
     about all the courses I am taking, rather than just one.
   - ⚠️ Currently trained on **all** [CPSC 455 website](https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc4552023s/) data (except slides) and the CPSC
     213 companion [(ref to a similar, but smaller version)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/213-10/resources/companion.pdf)

3. Developer/Admin Analytics Page ✅

   - As an admin/developer user, I want an enhanced analytics page
     providing data related to feedback so that
     I can have a comprehensive understanding of user interactions and
     optimize the platform accordingly.

4. **Chat Search Functionality** ✅

   - As a student user, I want to be able to access a search bar to search
     through all of my chats to easily locate information so that I can
     efficiently find the information I need without having to scroll through
     all my chats.

5. **Professor new CourseGPT model** ❌

   - As a professor user, I want to be able to upload PDF documents
     that will be used to create and **train a new course** so that
     students in my course can utilize ChatGPT.

6. **Community feature** ❌
   - As a student user, I want to be able to see popular questions
     asked by other students for a certain course and answers endorsed by
     instructors so that I can learn more from other student usage and what my
     instructors believe to be important.

     so that I can easily share valuable insights with others.

6. **Auto-training** ❌

   - As a professor user, I want to be able to link my mail or Piazza so that the model can be trained automatically,
     further reducing my involvement managing Q&A from students

7. **Piazza / Slack Integration** ❌

   - As a student user, I want my questions to be answered in a thread instantly by CourseGPT within existing platforms
     that I already use so that it does not disrupt my current workflow and so other students can see my questions
   - As a professor user, I want to have CourseGPT answer student questions within existing communication platforms
     so that I can monitor and guarantee CourseGPT is providing correct answers, or so I can expand on CourseGPT's
     answers
     and improve student learning further

8. **Deleting Train Data** ❌
   - As a proffesor user, I want to be able to see all of the data I have submitted to train my course and easily edit
     or delete the data so that students always have the most uo-to-date information.

## CPSC 455 Technology Usage

### HTML/CSS/Javascript

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was used for more than just building the app’s layout and basic styling. We used them to make
custom animations, scrollbars, canvas graphs integrations, accessibility enhancements, and responsiveness. Styles were
also organized into CSS modules for clean scoping.

### React and the “Front End”

React, along with redux and selectors, is used to manage the state and UI. We use redux to create asynchronous actions
and communicate with an API, with state elements being maintained and selected through redux slices and selectors.
Individual React components make up our application, with components separated into atoms, molecules, and organisms for
better organization.

### NodeJS and other “Back Ends”

In our project, Express is leveraged as the backend framework to manage routes, handle requests and responses, and
integrate with various custom and provided middleware functions. The express.json() and express.urlencoded() methods are
used to parse incoming requests and CORS is configured to handle cross-origin requests. Express serves both API routes
and static files, and our configuration is also adjusted depending on the environment.

### NoSQL with MongoDB

MongoDB enhanced our app’s ability to persist user data, including their account details, profile picture, affiliated
school/courses, chats and messages. This not only allowed a smoother user experience where all of their chats are
persisted between log-ins and a way to search old messages, but also a way for us to gather feedback and perform
analytics on user data to better improve our product in the future. In addition, storing embedding vectors in MongoDB
effectively saves cost in minimizing repetitive calls to the OpenAI API, as pre-generated embeddings from the API can be
directly retrieved from MongoDB when a user asks a question.

### Release Engineering

Heroku was used to deploy the application through adding `heroku-postbuild`, `postinstall`, and concurrently `start`
scripts
to our top level `package.json`. Additionally, our frontend Axios, and backend passport and express configuration, was configured to
point to localhost during development or staging, and to the Heroku URL for
production. From there, we connected heroku to our `main` branch, which automatically re-deployed our application after
after new commit to `main`.

## Above & Beyond Functionality

### Auto-Training & Q&A

This functionality is what allows our models for each course to grow, as per the professors requirements, offering
students access to any information the professor would like to programmatically provide.

When a professor submits text to train their course, the process begins mainly when the
`createEmbeddingForNewData` function is called to create embeddings for new data. It breaks down raw data into chunks,
normalizes and cleans the text, extracts keywords, and generates section titles. All of this is done to ensure that the
generated embeddings are optimized for future student queries. The resulting sections are then processed into embeddings using the Open AI API, then stored in the database,
in addition to a software cache for low-latency access on future student queries.

When a student submits a question, we
first create an embedding for the users question and compare its similarity to all the embeddings that exist for that
course. We then filter to collect the embedding information that meets a custom-defined relatedness threshold, while
ensuring our collected information stays under OpenAI's token limit. We then construct a sophisticated query that
includes the users original question, in addition to the embedding information that is most related to it. This query
then
gets sent to the original ChatGPT 4 model, which then returns an extensive, cohesive answer containing the information
the user had requested.

Both the auto-training and chat requests leverage polling. Without it, some requests would exceed Heroku's 30-second
request
timeout limit. In the `trainCurrentlySelectedDropdownCourse` and `getGptResponseInChat` async thunks, the system polls
every `n` seconds to check the training status of a course, and getting the GPT response, respectively. The polling
loops continue until the status is
marked as "complete".

#### Appendix A: Understanding Embeddings

In the context of natural language
processing (NLP), embeddings translate words into vectors of real numbers. These
decimal point values can then be leveraged for efficient similarity comparison between other embeddings.

#### Appendix B: Description of a Token

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), a token refers to a single unit that is a building block of a text
or document. It can be a word, a number, or even a punctuation mark.

### Global Chat Search

Introducing an unparalleled search functionality within CourseGPT, which allows seamless exploration of messages across
all chats within an user’s account. Leveraging MongoDB Atlas Search, we not only used advanced querying techniques, but
also incorporated a "fuzzy" search, enabling the system to find matches even with search string typos. The user
experience is elevated through an intuitively designed search UI, triggered by Ctrl+F or Cmd+F keyboard shortcuts. The
interface also enables users to commence typing keywords with dynamically fetched search results populating the screen
the moment they pause for 500 milliseconds. In addition, the search results pop up with highlighted keywords and are
organized by courses, showing how many results are in each course – giving you a quick and easy way to find what you're
looking for. And clicking on a search result reveals the corresponding chat and seamlessly navigates the screen to the
specific message featuring the keyword matches.

### Data Analysis

CourseGPT provides a sentiment analysis dashboard accessible by developers and admins. Feedback submitted by users is
computed to data points, which are then displayed into various scatter, bar, bubble, and word charts. By visualizing the
sentiments and its clusters, we are able to know where the critical areas of improvement are for our model. This
required in depth usage of course units including MongoDB and React, but also involved several things that were not
covered. We used several subsets of AI in our backend, including ML and NLP (in grouping textual similarity and
sentiment analysis)

## Next Steps

[Stretch Requirements/Ideas Added Mid-Project (2/7 ✅)](#stretch-requirementsideas-added-mid-project-27-)
The first is **Auto-training**, where professors can link their mail or Piazza for automatic course model training,
reducing their manual effort to train the model themselves on repetitive questions. The second idea focuses on \*
\*Piazza / Slack Integration** which allows CourseGPT to answer questions within existing platforms that both students
and professors use. The third enhancement, **Deleting Train Data\*\*, would enable professors to view, edit, or delete
training data, ensuring that the course information provided within CourseGPT remains up-to-date.

Bonus: Refactoring and ensuring production-level code quality and security.

## References

As developers, leveraging online resources is part of our workflow. As such, it was challenging for us to document every
single place we learned from throughout our code base. We used the Chakra UI, Mongo, NPM, Heroku, Redux, Passport, JWT,
Axios, and other documentation. Additionally, we learned some sections from online YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow,
and ChatGPT.
Some code was adapted from ChatGPT and Stack Overflow, and we tried to document this in relevant locations. However,
easily over
95% of our project was written by us.
